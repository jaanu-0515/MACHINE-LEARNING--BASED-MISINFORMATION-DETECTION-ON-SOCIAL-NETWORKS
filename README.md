# MACHINE-LEARNING--BASED-MISINFORMATION-DETECTION-ON-SOCIAL-NETWORKS

In today’s digital era, social media platforms have become major sources of information sharing. However, the rapid spread of fake news and misinformation has become a serious global issue. This project aims to build an AI-driven system that automatically detects and classifies misinformation using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The system analyzes text-based data from social media or news headlines, learns linguistic patterns, and predicts whether the content is Real or Fake. It also includes an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time user interaction and visualization of model performance.


🚀 Key Features

📰 Input Support: Accepts text input such as news headlines or social media posts

🤖 ML-Powered Prediction: Uses advanced models like BERT and Neural Networks

🧹 Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization

🔍 Fact Verification: Integrates the Google Fact Check API for improved accuracy

📊 Data Visualization: Shows prediction confidence and dataset distribution

🌐 Web Interface: User-friendly Streamlit app for real-time testing

⚙️ How It Works

Input: User enters or uploads text (news or social media post).

Preprocessing: The text is cleaned, tokenized, and lemmatized using NLP tools.

Model Prediction: The trained ML model predicts whether the content is real or fake.

Output: Displays classification results with confidence score.

Visualization: Shows accuracy metrics and dataset distribution on the web dashboard.
